# go_service_template
A Template To Fork To Create a new Go Backend Service (With Database)

After creating a new project with this template, replace ALL occurrences of "template-service" with the name of your actual service. Also, all occurrences of "templateservice" (case insensitive).

The global readme should contain a high level description of the service, design principles and best practices, and instructions on running in dev, how to debug, links to any relavent documentation.
